Advent Of Code 2022
===================

This repo will contain my (attempted) solutions for Advent Of Code 2022. They will not be optimal, that is really not
the idea - they will mostly be quickly put together hacks just to try and save Christmas in time. Sorry about that. You
should probably not use this as learning material or sample code for anything, but we will let that up to your
judgement.

Merry Christmas :)
